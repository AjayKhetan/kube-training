## What is Service Mesh?

---

# What is Service Mesh?
* Network services for **microservices**
* Policy-based, enforces behaviors
* Manages topology, changing conditions: load, configuration, resources
* Spans clusters/clouds (Mesos clusters, VMs, Cloud, K8s, Consul)
* Provides discovery, load balancing, failure recovery, and observability
* Supports A/B testing, canary releases, rate limiting, access control, 0 trust networks

---
# What is Service Mesh?

* Addressable infrastructure layer
* Developer-driven, services-first network
* Takes network concerns out of service / application code (e.g., resiliency, circuit breakers, etc.)
* Declaratively define network behavior by policy: node identity, routing, balancing, and traffic flow
* Language and framework agnostic support for observability and tracing
* ~= Cloud Native Software defined network

## Architecture

---
# Service Mesh - Architecture
* Management Plane
* Control Plane
* Data Plane
* Ingress Gateway
* Egress Gateway

___

## Service Mesh - Architecture
# Management Plane
* Governance - Multi-cluster and multi-mesh
* Integration with existing clouds and environments  
* Federation
* Intelligent services

___

## Service Mesh - Architecture
# Control Plane
* Policy, config, routes, rules and platform integration
* Configs Set of Side car service proxies (per pod)
* Does not intercept or route any network traffic
* Config and config propagation

___

## Service Mesh - Architecture
# Data Plane
* Uses configured policies, routes, rules and platform integration
* Intercepts and routes network traffic
* Encryption (TLS), Authentication, and Authorization
* Health checks, routing, load balancing, and observability
* Service Discovery

____

## Service Mesh - Architecture
* Service meshes consist of service proxies (data plane), which are configured by the control plane
* Traffic is intercepted using iptables rules per pod
* Service Mesh: Combination of policies managed by control plane plus data plane that implements policy behavior plus service deployments
* Istio turns disparate microservices into an integrated service mesh
  * by systemically injecting service proxy that controls all network paths
